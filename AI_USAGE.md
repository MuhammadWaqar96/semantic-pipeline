# AI Usage

I used ChatGPT to:
- Design the semantic pipeline architecture
- Decide on chunking and embedding strategies
- Generate boilerplate Node.js API code
- Refine the data model to support versioning and metadata
- Optimize for a minimal but spec-compliant implementation

I iteratively prompted ChatGPT to simplify the system due to time constraints, and intentionally mocked AI extraction and embeddings to focus on system design rather than external dependencies.
